## Sidebar

### Something 3rd level

In order to have sidebar, then you can create your own `_sidebar.md` (see [this documentation's sidebar](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/blob/master/docs/_sidebar.md) for an example):

First, you need to set `loadSidebar` to **true**. Details are available in the [configuration paragraph](configuration.md#loadsidebar).

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true
  }
</script>
<script src="//unpkg.com/docsify/lib/docsify.min.js"></script>
```

Create the `_sidebar.md`:

```markdown
<!-- docs/_sidebar.md -->

* [Home](/)
* [Guide](guide.md)
```

You need to create a `.nojekyll` in `./docs` to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore.

## Nested Sidebars

You may want the sidebar to update with only navigation to reflect the current directory. This can be done by adding a `_sidebar.md` file to each folder.

`_sidebar.md` is loaded from each level directory. If the current directory doesn't have `_sidebar.md`, it will fall back to the parent directory. If, for example, the current path is `/guide/quick-start`, the `_sidebar.md` will be loaded from `/guide/_sidebar.md`.

You can specify `alias` to avoid unnecessary fallback.

```html
<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    loadSidebar: true,
    alias: {
      '/.*/_sidebar.md': '/_sidebar.md'
    }
  }
</script>
```
